This binary search tree project was created for The Odin Project.

This took me a long time to do as there was a lot of personal things going on in my life at the time that both took up my time and sapped my motivation somewhat. But it's finished. I didn't feel like using my template repository and setting it up the bells and whistles (Webpack etc.) since it's a simple project.
